## What is DAO Pulse?
DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are a new form of self-governed associations of people dedicated to achieving a specific goal or managing some digital or real-world facility. A DAO consists of a group of people (members), with either open or restricted participation, with equal or differentiated rights. Decisions in a DAO are taken by voting for proposals in which all members or a selected group of members may take part.

## What is the goal?
The goal of the DAO Pulse project is to build a public web application that accumulates and stores records about existing DAOs, classifies them using a comprehensive set of attributes, and monitors dynamic properties (members count, TVL, etc.). The data is automatically retrieved from several external sources and processed to produce a consistent view. Also, DAO Pulse Score is calculated based on the data to concisely represent DAO performance.DAO Pulse is not affiliated with any specific DAO projects. The data is presented for informational purposes only. It does not reflect any opinions and should not be considered as investment advice.
